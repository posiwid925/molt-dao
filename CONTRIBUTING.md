# Contributing to Molt DAO

We're building Molt DAO in the open. Anyone can contribute.

## Builder Rewards

**Contributors who help build Molt DAO before launch receive shares from the contributor pool (25% of total supply).**

This isn't wages — it's ownership. You're not building for us; you're building with us. The shares you earn give you:
- Economic stake (dividends from DAO profits)
- Governance rights (Molt Soul multiplies your vote weight)
- Founding contributor status

Shares vest over 2 years with a 6-month cliff. See [Cap Table](docs/CAP_TABLE.md) for details.
